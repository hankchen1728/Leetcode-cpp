# 116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node
- Link: [https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node/](https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node/)

## Idea
For each time recursion, we expect that the input node `*root` has been connected to its next (if not exist, then `nullptr`).

Hence we can directly link it's next layer: link its right to its left (the right node is the next of the left node), and if its next node exists, then link the left of its next node to its right
```cpp
root->left->next = root->right;
if (root->next != nullptr) {
  root->right->next = root->next->left;
}
```
After linking we also need to perform the same connection on the left and right node, until we achieve the leaf nodes.

## Problem Statement
<p>You are given a <strong>perfect binary tree</strong> where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:</p>

<pre>struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
</pre>

<p>Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to <code>NULL</code>.</p>

<p>Initially, all next pointers are set to <code>NULL</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/14/116_sample.png" style="width: 500px; height: 171px;">
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
<strong>Output:</strong> [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,6,7,#]
<strong>Explanation: </strong>Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> root = []
<strong>Output:</strong> []
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The number of nodes in the tree is in the range <code>[0, 2<sup>12</sup> - 1]</code>.</li>
	<li><code>-1000 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 1000</code></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Follow-up:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>You may only use constant extra space.</li>
	<li>The recursive approach is fine. You may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.</li>
</ul>
