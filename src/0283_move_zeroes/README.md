# 283. Move Zeroes
- Link: [https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)

## Idea
Set a pointer for recording the position of first zero in current iteration, i.e. number of non-zero element traversed until current itertation.

## Problem Statement
<div><p>Given an integer array <code>nums</code>, move all <code>0</code>'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
<strong>Output:</strong> [1,3,12,0,0]
</pre><p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [0]
<strong>Output:</strong> [0]
</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>-2<sup>31</sup> &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1</code></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Follow up:</strong> Could you minimize the total number of operations done?</div>

## Hints
1. **In-place** means we should not be allocating any space for extra array. But we are allowed to modify the existing array. However, as a first step, try coming up with a solution that makes use of additional space. For this problem as well, first apply the idea discussed using an additional array and the in-place solution will pop up eventually.
2. A **two-pointer** approach could be helpful here. The idea would be to have one pointer for iterating the array and another pointer that just works on the non-zero elements of the array.
